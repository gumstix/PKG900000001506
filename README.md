**The Gumstix Raspberry Pi CM Robo** carrier board is a slim, computer vision-capable multimedia platform designed with miniature autonomous vehicles in mind.  The dual Raspberry Pi Camera connectors can provide either stereoscopic depth mapping for object avoidance or front- and back-facing cameras for feature identification or manual control.

I2C and UART serial connections, exposed via JST GH-style headers, can be used to connect either to PWM motor controller boards, or to a control MCU.

Instantly upgrade your project with the Gumstix Raspberry Pi CM4 Uprev board and take advantage of the CM4's increased horsepower.  Or go even further with the UprevAI and add a Google Coral TPU for lightning-fast TensorFlow processing.
